# Repository for the computational part of the Kv4.3 channel paper

## Structure of the folder

There are 3 folders containing the input necessary to reproduce the simulations using NAMD2.13 (can be compatible also for successive versions) for the 

 1. Wild Type system 
 2. M373I point mutation 
 3. S390N point mutation

Moreover there is also a folder containing the structure and a small sample of the trajectory (movie) that can be uploaded and seen in any available visualization software (VMD, Chimera, PyMol etc.)
